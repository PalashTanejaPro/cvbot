This repository is mainly a collection of plugins that are written for
[errbot](http://errbot.io). Errbot is a Python based chatbot framework.

As described on Errbot website:
> Errbot is a chatbot, a daemon that connects to your favorite chat service
  and brings your tools into the conversation.

It handles sending messages to correct rooms/person, receiving messages,
calling your command routines on matching commands, etc. These command routines
are added by writing plugins, which are collected and loaded by Errbot when it
is ran.
