It looks like your PR is out of date and needs a rebase.

[This page](https://cloudcv.io/rebase) may help you to get started on this. We also have [a quick video tutorial on how to rebase](https://asciinema.org/a/78683). That should help you understand the basics of how it works and what you should be doing.

If you're just looking to fix an issue very quickly and not interested in contributing to cloudcv long term, we can fix it up for you - just tell us :).
