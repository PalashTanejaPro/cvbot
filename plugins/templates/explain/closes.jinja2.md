We use bug prediction in cloudcv which relies on the `Fixes` keyword in commit messages. To get good results from that we need to use `Closes` for normal issues instead of `Fixes` which should only be used for real bugs. (See also [the commit message docs](https://cloudcv.io/commit).) To change your message you just use `git commit --amend` and then `git push --force` the new commit to replace the old one.
